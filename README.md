# AutotestGenerator
 AutotestGenerator --- A test generation utility written in scheme/racket back to Fall 2013 as a teaching assistant for UW course CS135.

A work term project I did back to Fall 2013. Before the program is ever
made, TA usually manually create test case file that takes about 5 hrs pe
assignment * 11 assignment per term. After my change, test generate
usually takes about 40 min to create that improve the efficiency greatly.

Usage:
I long forget how to use this utility since it's close to 2016 Xmas now. 
However, I did remember to create a usual manual at that time. So, check "Autotest Generator User Guide.pdf".
I also did a presentation at the end of that term, for detail see "CS135 Autotest Generator.pdf"
